# Imagepicker

Sample code to build image selection control. 

The control can be further enhanced to upload the selected image file to any file store of choice.

External Dependencies:

1. [MUI Controls](https://material-ui.com/)
2. [MUI Icons](https://material-ui.com/components/material-icons/)
3. [React hook form](https://react-hook-form.com/api/)

# Steps to run
```
$ git clone https://github.com/adityad89/Imagepicker.git
cd Imagepicker
```

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ npm start
```

# Note

1. Select an image and click on upload
2. Check the file object logged to the console
3. The File will only be logged to the console only if an image is selected, as the control is marked as required using react-hook-form validation
